Feature: Add two numbers
In order to count how many apples I've collected
As an apple-hoarder
I want to add two numbers together

    Scenario: Add two numbers together
        Given I have 5 apples
        When I add 6 more
        Then the result should be 11

    Scenario: Add two numbers together again
        Given I have 6 apples
        When I add 7 more
        Then the result should be 13
